# Learn GitHub better
- I want to make a plan to learn about GitHub.
- I've been working with Git and Bitbucket for years.
- I wan't to be proficient with GitHub and GitHub actions so I am prepared to hit the ground running for new projects or new Jobs that use GitHub.
- I've worked with Jenkins for years; primarility using it in the context of a software development team. I don't aminister Jenkins or BitBucket.
- Also, if there are new and helpful things I don't know about GitHub, I'd like to learn them.
- I can't work this full time. Maybe an hour so on weekdays and a little more on weekends.
- I have an O'Reilly subscription for learning. But, the GitHub things on there seem to have a lot of focus on Git (which I already know). I wan't to focus what GitHub provides apart from just Git.
- Please store the plan in this folder so we can adjust it over time as needed.
